# Node-Express-mongoDB Blog

## This is a simple blog using 
#### 1. NodeJS
#### 2. ExpressJS
#### 3. MongoDB

This demo blog project is simple you can post and delete a blog here, well anyone can lol. I've followed **MVC pattern** here and **Bootstrap 4.5** for CSS and also some custom css.  

#### Download/Clone Project
**Open your terminal and type** 
    `npm install`
**Then to run the app type**
    `npm run start`
    
**PS: I used MongoDB ATLAS you have to copy your cluster URL and paste in the app.js line no 12**
